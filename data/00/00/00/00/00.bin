  |   Notes:                                                                |

  |   We are more than 1 year into the NSW scene, many things have          |
  |   changed and evolved. Sadly, after +1 year, we can see that            |
  |   competition focuses on duping us rather than preing one of the MANY   |
  |   missing pres.                                                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Indeed, it seems our competition has nothing better to do than        |
  |   duping us by preing the XCI of the same game right after our eShop    |
  |   pre. This release is not an eShop pre, but if this was an eShop       |
  |   pre, you can be sure it wouldn't have an eShop tag. You got away so   |
  |   far preing without any tag your blatant dupes (making them look       |
  |   like brand new games and profiting of the eShop tag) but this has     |
  |   to come to an end.                                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   That's right, we think the time has come to drop the eShop tag,       |
  |   -which was not even a rule to begin with-. To other groups, it's      |
  |   also time for you guys to simply admit you just lost the race. Now    |
  |   step up, go try to win the race on a BRAND new game instead of        |
  |   preing it anyway. Many games remain unpred by the way.                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   As you all know (hopefully), a game is a game. Whether you boot it    |
  |   from a NSP or a XCI (which needs SXOS anyway, a PAID CFW that is      |
  |   NOT even free and thus not used by everyone) won't change the fact    |
  |   the game is the EXACT same. Hell, actually the XCI even has longer    |
  |   loading times than a game installed to NAND/SD (that's right, go      |
  |   compare Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze loading times in XCI vs   |
  |   NSP, and you won't look back).                                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   That's right folks, XCI and NSP are nothing but containers: as in     |
  |   they just contain NCAs that the console will mount and boot up the    |
  |   game, that's all they are. Yep, eShop games have an extra crypto      |
  |   layer (titlekey), so what? It is transparent to the end user and      |
  |   doesn't impact performances AT ALL. And if for some weird reason      |
  |   the idea of using the titlekey crypto is disgusting (even though      |
  |   the eShop NCAs are 1:1 from Nintendo), there are plenty of tools      |
  |   (one-click tool) to strip it away from the NSP (and thus, no ticket   |
  |   is needed, just like a XCI).                                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Or maybe there is another reason you prefer the XCI? Let me guess,    |
  |   because you think you are safe to play online? Nope, you are not.     |
  |   You are only safe if you dump your OWN XCI cert, which means you      |
  |   already own the original game anyway, so why the hell did you even    |
  |   leech our release? Breaking news for you, Nintendo doesn't give a     |
  |   damn whether you pirate NSP or XCI, they only care if you pirate AT   |
  |   ALL.                                                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   But we already hear ya, "but but but I don't like NSP because my      |
  |   NAND will have dirty tickets". Nope, telemetry doesn't send your      |
  |   installed tickets to Nintendo but well, even if you still believe     |
  |   so, feel free to remove titlekey crypto like said previously and      |
  |   play it that way. Or convert your NSP to XCI (which will obviously    |
  |   remove the titlekey crypto too).                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Anyway, if you are paranoid about bans, chances are you are           |
  |   probably using emuMMC/emuNAND anyway so why the hell are you          |
  |   debating on this again since you don't even have pirated games on     |
  |   your "legit" NAND?                                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Finally, after all this, if for some reason you still prefer XCI (a   |
  |   legit reason would be: SXOS can mount them for a quick test, and      |
  |   I'm a lazy ass and don't want to install it, OR I wanna mount them    |
  |   from USB) well, convert the NSP to XCI and mount it the same way      |
  |   you would enjoy the very same XCI dupes.                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Oh and we see you coming "but but my converted XCI is dirty and       |
  |   baby wipes were not used" (aka header is not signed by Nintendo       |
  |   private keys). Yes? So what? It's not like your CFW isn't patching    |
  |   sig checks anyway to even MOUNT them so why complain? Oh because      |
  |   you wanna play online? Well we are back to square one, if you wanna   |
  |   play it online, it means you have bought the LEGIT game already.      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Should we remind you who brought you SOLUTIONS for Hellblade,         |
  |   Grandia Collection, Hotline Miami, Doom 1 and Doom 2 when NOBODY      |
  |   stepped to fix these non working games?. Has the scene become "It's   |
  |   not my fault, I'm a dump monkey, I don't give a damn if it's not      |
  |   working, maybe P2P will fix it"?! Or should we remind you who is      |
  |   actually preing COMPLETE games (as in, not limiting ourselves to      |
  |   preing incomplete games/buggy games without "mandatory/needed" day    |
  |   1 updates). As some real old-school legends have said once: never     |
  |   bite the hand that feeds you folks, otherwise you'd be stuck          |
  |   playing lame NES emulators on your wonderful machines. But it's not   |
  |   all negative here, we'd like to say thanks to all our fans and        |
  |   supporters, and this game is dedicated to you.                        |
